# Fraud Detection ML Application

An end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to detect fraudulent transactions using a structured, production-ready pipeline and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## Objective

To build a scalable and interpretable fraud detection system capable of identifying high-risk transactions with strong predictive performance.

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy: 94%**
- Optimized through hyperparameter tuning
- Built with a fully integrated preprocessing + modeling pipeline

## Methodology

### 1️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature distribution analysis
- Correlation assessment
- Class imbalance evaluation
- Identification of high-impact variables

### 2️ Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Implemented using **Scikit-learn Pipeline** to ensure reproducibility and production readiness:

- `StandardScaler` for numerical feature normalization
- `OneHotEncoder` for categorical feature encoding
- `ColumnTransformer` for structured preprocessing

### 3️ Modeling
- **Logistic Regression**
- Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
- Evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end ML workflow design
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Pipeline architecture for deployment
- Model evaluation & performance optimization
- Model serialization and production deployment
- Streamlit-based ML app development

## 🚀 Deployment

The model is deployed via **Streamlit Cloud**, enabling real-time fraud predictions through an interactive interface.
